It takes place primarily in the **chloroplasts** of plant cells, specifically using a green pigment called **chlorophyll** that absorbs light energy.\n\nThis process is fundamental to life on Earth. Not only does it produce the glucose that plants need for respiration, growth, and reproduction, but it also releases **oxygen** as a by-product — the very gas that animals (including us) need to breathe."

Light energy is required for the reaction to proceed, and chlorophyll acts as a catalyst."

Leaves are adapted for efficient photosynthesis in several ways:\n\n- **Broad and flat shape** — provides a large surface area to absorb light\n- **Thin structure** — short diffusion distance for gases\n- **Stomata on the underside** — allow CO₂ in and O₂ out\n- **Network of veins** — delivers water from the roots and carries away glucose\n- **Palisade mesophyll cells near the top surface** — packed with chloroplasts to capture the most light"

      "content": "## The two stages of photosynthesis\n\nAt GCSE level, you should be aware that photosynthesis occurs in **two main stages**. Higher-tier students in particular need to understand the distinction.\n\n### Stage 1: Light-dependent reactions\n\nThese reactions take place in the **thylakoid membranes** of the chloroplasts and require light energy directly. During this stage:\n\n1. Light energy is absorbed by **chlorophyll**\n2. Water molecules are **split** (photolysis) into hydrogen and oxygen\n3. The oxygen is released as a **by-product**\n4. The hydrogen and energy are passed to the next stage\n\n### Stage 2: Light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle)\n\nThese reactions occur in the **stroma** of the chloroplasts. They do not require light directly, but they do depend on the products of the light-dependent stage:\n\n1. Carbon dioxide combines with hydrogen (from stage 1) to produce **glucose**\n2. This process is powered by the energy transferred from the light-dependent reactions\n3. The glucose can then be used for respiration, converted to starch for storage, or used to make cellulose, proteins, and lipids"

      "content": "## Limiting factors\n\nA **limiting factor** is any factor that, when in short supply, slows down the rate of photosynthesis regardless of how much of the other factors are available. The three main limiting factors are:\n\n### 1. Light intensity\n\nAs light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases — up to a point. Eventually, the graph **plateaus** because another factor (such as CO₂ concentration or temperature) becomes limiting. At very low light intensities, the plant may actually consume more oxygen in respiration than it produces in photosynthesis.\n\n### 2. Carbon dioxide concentration\n\nCO₂ is one of the raw materials for photosynthesis. Increasing the concentration of CO₂ increases the rate of photosynthesis until something else becomes limiting. In commercial greenhouses, farmers sometimes pump extra CO₂ into the air to boost crop yields.\n\n### 3. Temperature\n\nTemperature affects the **enzymes** involved in photosynthesis. As temperature increases, the rate increases because molecules have more kinetic energy and collide more frequently. However, if the temperature gets too high (typically above **40-45°C**), the enzymes **denature** and the rate drops sharply."

It uses an aquatic plant (usually **pondweed** such as *Elodea*) to measure the rate of photosynthesis by counting oxygen bubbles.\n\n### Method\n\n1. Place a piece of pondweed in a beaker of water with a small amount of **sodium hydrogen carbonate** (to ensure CO₂ is not limiting)\n2. Set up a **lamp** at a measured distance from the beaker\n3. Leave for **five minutes** to allow the plant to acclimatise\n4. Count the number of **oxygen bubbles** produced in one minute\n5. Repeat at different distances (e.g. 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm)\n6. Repeat each distance **three times** and calculate a mean\n\n### Key variables\n\n- **Independent variable:** distance of the lamp (which changes light intensity)\n- **Dependent variable:** number of oxygen bubbles per minute\n- **Control variables:** temperature (use a heat shield), CO₂ concentration, same piece of pondweed, same volume of water"

Plants convert glucose to starch for storage because insoluble starch does not affect the water potential of cells, so it won't cause water to move in by osmosis."
