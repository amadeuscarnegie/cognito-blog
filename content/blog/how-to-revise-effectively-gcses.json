The good news? Switching to evidence-based techniques can dramatically improve your results without increasing your study time.\n\nIn this guide, we'll walk through the revision strategies that cognitive science has proven to work — and show you how to build them into your GCSE preparation."

			"content": "## Active recall: the single best technique\n\nActive recall means testing yourself on material rather than passively reviewing it. Every time you successfully retrieve information from memory, you strengthen the neural pathways that store it.\n\n### How to practise active recall\n\n- **Flashcards** — Write a question on one side and the answer on the other. Test yourself regularly.\n- **Practice questions** — Work through past papers and exam-style questions without looking at your notes.\n- **The blank page method** — Close your textbook, grab a blank sheet, and write down everything you can remember about a topic. Then check what you missed.\n\n> \"Students who practised active recall retained 50% more information after one week compared to those who simply re-read their notes.\" — Karpicke & Blunt, 2011"

Instead of cramming everything the night before, you spread your revision over days and weeks.\n\n### A simple spacing schedule\n\n1. Review new material the same day you learn it\n2. Review again after 1 day\n3. Review again after 3 days\n4. Review again after 7 days\n5. Review again after 14 days"
